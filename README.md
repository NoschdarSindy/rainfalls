This application shows the temporal development of heavy rainfalls from a dataset. It does so using various visualisation techniques. The data can be filtered by its attributes and selected intervals can be compared (cf. the Interval A and Interval B windows) and explored further. It follows the principle of "Overview First â€” Details on Demand". The application can be easily adapted to show the development of any kind of spatiotemporal data across time.

### Starting up the application

1. Run `make build`

2. Run `make run`

3. Check out the App at localhost:3000
